# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning: Navigation Report

## General Ideas of the implemented DQN Algorithm
  1. Off-policy Learning with Local & Target QNetworks
  2. The Local QNetwork is trained primarily with Simulated Experience   
  3. A simple Neural Net with three fully connected layers (64 units per hidden layers) as the QNetworks.

## Ideas for Future Work
Try to implement the below algorithms on top of the current codebase:
  1. Double DQN
  2. Prioritized Experience Replay
  3. Dueling DQN
  4. Rainbow
